CSS : Cascading StyleSheets
What is cascade in CSS?
The CSS cascade algorithm's job is to select CSS declarations in order to determine the correct values for CSS properties.

    h2{
        background-color:yellow;
    }
    h2{
        background-color:blue;
    }



Selector Specificity 
What is Specificity? 
Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration.

____    ______________________________    __________________________
id      class,attribute & pseudo-class     element & pseudo-element


What to remember?
1.importance in decreasing order :
            id > class > element
2. more selectors (better to use ) than  less selector - as CSS gets more priority with more selectors
3. if Specificity same => see cascading
4. Inline Style has the highest priority , once implementedw we can't make further change - so avoid using inline sytle



!important - to show the most specific thing in document

    h2{
        background-color: blue !important;
    }
